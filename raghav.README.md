## Core Problem Analysis

The initial codebase had the following critical issues:

1. **Performance & Scalability**

   * N+1 query problems in tasks endpoints.
   * Inefficient in-memory filtering and pagination.
   * Batch operations processed sequentially, causing multiple DB roundtrips.
   * Unoptimized data access patterns.

2. **Architectural Weaknesses**

   * Controllers directly accessing repositories.
   * Missing domain abstractions and service boundaries.
   * Lack of transaction management for multi-step operations.
   * Tightly coupled components.

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**

   * Weak authentication and missing refresh token rotation.
   * Improper authorization checks.
   * Exposed sensitive data in error responses.
   * Insecure and unscalable rate limiting.

4. **Reliability & Resilience Gaps**

   * Ineffective error handling.
   * No retry mechanisms for distributed operations.
   * Lack of graceful degradation.
   * In-memory caching unsuitable for distributed environments.

## Architectural Approach

* **Domain Separation**:

  * Created separate modules for Users, Tasks, Auth, and Queues.
  * Services handle business logic; controllers delegate only request/response handling.

* **Service Abstractions**:

  * TasksService, UsersService, and AuthService encapsulate all business operations.
  * Queues and processors decouple background jobs from HTTP requests.

* **Transaction Management**:

  * Used TypeORM transactions for multi-step updates (e.g., task updates with queue enqueue).

* **Advanced Patterns**:

  * Implemented **CQRS** for task processing: Commands update task state, queries fetch optimized views.
  * Event-driven task queue using BullMQ.

---

## Performance Improvements

* Optimized queries with **eager loading** to prevent N+1 issues.
* Implemented **database-level filtering and pagination** instead of in-memory operations.
* Bulk operations for batch task updates/deletes.
* Added **indexes** on `task.status`, `task.priority`, `user.email` for faster lookups.
* Distributed caching via Redis for frequently accessed data.
* Asynchronous queue processing for long-running operations.

---

## Security Enhancements

* **Authentication & Authorization**

  * JWT with refresh token rotation.
  * Proper role-based access control using Guards.

* **Data Protection**

  * Sanitized all inputs using Validation Pipes.
  * Passwords hashed using bcrypt.

* **Rate Limiting**

  * Redis-backed distributed rate limiting.

* **Error Handling**

  * Standardized HTTP error responses with HttpExceptionFilter.

---


* **CQRS Complexity**: Adds additional code and abstractions but provides scalability and decouples reads from writes.
* **Redis Requirement**: Adds operational overhead; simpler setups could use in-memory cache but at the cost of multi-instance safety.
* **Bulk Operations**: Slightly more complex code but significantly improves performance under high load.

## Setup & Running

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Run database migrations
npm run typeorm:migrate

# Start application
npm run start:prod
```

---

## Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests**: Services, Guards, Pipes, Interceptors.
* **Integration Tests**: End-to-end API testing with Supertest.
* **End-to-End Tests**: Verify user flows, authentication, task operations, and queue processing.
* **Coverage**: `> 90%` for core modules.

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test
npm run test:e2e
```
